Results are presented of a search for a heavy Majorana neutrino $\mathrm{N}_{\ell}$ decaying into two same-flavor leptons $\ell$ (electrons or muons) and a quark-pair jet. A model is considered in which the $\mathrm{N}_{\ell}$ is an excited neutrino in a compositeness scenario. The analysis is performed using a sample of proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$ recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138~\fbinv. The data are found to be in agreement with the standard model prediction. For the process in which the $\mathrm{N}_{\ell}$ is produced in association with a lepton, followed by the decay of the $\mathrm{N}_{\ell}$ to a same-flavor lepton and a quark pair, an upper limit at $95\%$ confidence level on the product of the cross section and branching fraction is obtained as a function of the $\mathrm{N}_{\ell}$ mass $m_{\mathrm{N}_{\ell}}$ and the compositeness scale $\Lambda$.
For this model the data exclude the existence of $\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{e}}$ ($\mathrm{N}_{\PGm}$)
for $m_{\mathrm{N}_{\ell}}$ below 6.0\,(6.1)\TeV at the limit where $m_{\mathrm{N}_{\ell}}$ is equal to $\Lambda$.  For $m_{\mathrm{N}_{\ell}}\approx1\TeV$, values of $\Lambda$ less than 20\,(23)\TeV are excluded.
These results represent a considerable improvement in sensitivity, covering a larger parameter space than previous searches in $\Pp\Pp$ collisions at 13\TeV.
